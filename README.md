A sample project for Android that shows a list of github users fetched from github API.
## Development patterns, kits, languages & APIs:
- Kotlin, Kotlin coroutines, Kotlin Flows for asynchronous programming.
- Hilt for dependency management.
- MVVM design pattern.
- SSOT concept
- Coil,Lottie
- Interface driven development, loose coupling between layers.

## Things to consider  :

- Design-system theming & components design for scalability
- TDD
- Jetpack compose : (UI,State management,Navigation...)
- Gradle KTS, BuildSrc , Gradle extension to ease the project dependencies management and upgrades.


## Features to improve:
- Search a user in the recyclerview
- Make the image base url fetching more configurable.
- Handle Bearer token with auth interceptor for retrofit.


#  Notice : 
### The auth token is provided by github, you can generate one here for a safer use :
